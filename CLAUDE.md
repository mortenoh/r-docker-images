# Claude Code Guidelines

## Commit Messages
- Always use conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, ci
- No attribution lines (no "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By")

## Examples
```
feat: add INLA Docker image support
fix(dockerfile): correct runtime library packages
ci: add GitHub Actions workflow for multi-arch builds
docs: update README with usage instructions
```
